https://ahong14.github.io/updated_nba_rosters/

Updated version from previous project.
Applied frameworks such as Bootstrap and
Angular for cleaner UI compared to previous
project. 

The goal of this project to view players 
associated with each NBA Team. In this version, 
only players in the starting lineup are 
available for each team.

Implemented Boostrap to create a navbar
for user to select team to view based
on division. Each division contains
associated teams as a dropdown item
for user to choose from. When clicking 
a team, the site animates to that team's
page id and its roster is shown. User can
jump to different teams using the navbar
at the top of the page.

Used Bootstrap to create a carousel
of slideshow images within a jumbotron
to provide an introduction to the page.

Implemented AngularJS to store player info
as objects. Each team has an array of player 
objects containing information such as height,
weight, position, and predraft info. 

When a user hovers over a player image, the image
animates and is clickable. When an image is clicked,
that player's information is displayed using ng-show
and ng-click. 

User can return back to the top of the page by 
clicking the NBA icon at the top left, serving
as the home button.
